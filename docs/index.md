# Thycotic Secret Server - Terraform Provider

The [Thycotic](https://thycotic.com/) [Secret Server](https://thycotic.com/products/secret-server/) [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) Provider allows you to access and reference Secrets in your vault for use in Terraform configurations.

This is a fork of Thycotics's original Secret Server provider,with the following improvements:
* Incorporates the changes made in newer versions of the TSS SDK for Go to support using the Domain-attribute in the user credentials
* Rewritten to use Terraform Provider SDK v2
* Adds the possibility to create secrets, not just read existing ones.
* You can optionally avoid duplicates (will re-use an exisiting secret with the same name, site and folder you provided in your resource)

Please note that Thycotic is now Delinea. This provider uses a modified version of the Delinea TSS SDK for GO under the hood.


## Example Usage

For Terraform 0.13+, include the `terraform` block in your configuration or plan to that specifies the provider:

```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
        tss = {
            source = "norskhelsenett/tss"
            version = "~> 0.3.0"
        }
    }
}
```

To run the example, create a `terraform.tfvars`:

```json
tss_username   = "my_app_user"
tss_password   = "Passw0rd."
tss_domain     = "foo.bar"
tss_server_url = "https://localhost/SecretServer"
tss_secret_id  = "1"
```
