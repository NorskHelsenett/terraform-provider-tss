# Thycotic Secret Server - Terraform Provider

The [Thycotic](https://thycotic.com/) [Secret Server](https://thycotic.com/products/secret-server/) [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) Provider allows you to access and reference Secrets in your vault for use in Terraform configurations.

This is a fork of the Thycotic provider which includes functionality to specify domain along with the credentials.
Also adds the possibility to create secrets, not just read existing ones.

## Example Usage

For Terraform 0.13+, include the `terraform` block in your configuration or plan to that specifies the provider:

```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
        tss = {
            source = "norskhelsenett/tss"
            version = "~> 0.2.1"
        }
    }
}
```

To run the example, create a `terraform.tfvars`:

```json
tss_username   = "my_app_user"
tss_password   = "Passw0rd."
tss_domain     = "foo.bar"
tss_server_url = "https://localhost/SecretServer"
tss_secret_id  = "1"
```

### Required

- **password** (String) The password of the Secret Server User
- **server_url** (String) The Secret Server base URL e.g. https://localhost/SecretServer
- **username** (String) The username of the Secret Server User to connect as

### Optional
